# Libbie

Libbie seeks to provide a quick, simple way to import a collection of books into one or more websites for managing such libraries, such as:
 - Goodreads

Libbie is designed to work with little configuration with standard barcode scanners without fuss. It should be the optimal way for the book aficionado to managing their massive and ever-growing collection of books.
